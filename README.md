# Flash App

React training project by smizzle-probably. Create, save, load decks and test yourself out on them.

Bootstrapped via [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Tiff In Tech "todo list" video was the boilerplate.

## Bugs and todo

TODO:
-Carry the current deck between Deck Editor and Challenge when changing screens (redux / state management)

-CSS / UI enhancements:
-desktop res: side-by-side prompt / picture
-mobile res: top/bottom
-Deck Editor page structure:
-Add mobile vs. desktop view
-Challenge "Load Deck" area - make it pretty
-Make challenge screen work for mobile (NO swipe down - this is easily confused with refresh and will break mobile websites)
-remove "rounded-corners" css class - make view modern

Animations + funky features:
-Item Added + removed animation
-reorder deck items by clicking and dragging
