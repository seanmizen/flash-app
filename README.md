# Flash App

React training project by Sean Mizen. Create, save, load decks and test yourself out on them.

Bootstrapped via [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Tiff In Tech "todo list" video was the boilerplate.

## Running the app

Start the app with `npm start` or build the project with `npm run build`

deployment workflows are included, but will only work for seanmizen for now. useful as boilerplate.

## TODO:

- Fix light / dark theme. currently hardcoded to auto/system with a dysfunctional button.
- Convert ItemList into a drag-and-drop using react-dnd
- improve UI - use Material Design guides, improve and de-grey the palette.
- improve UX - find some inspo for a better Challenge screen.
