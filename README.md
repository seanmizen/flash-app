# Flash App

React training project by smizzle-probably. Create, save, load decks and test yourself out on them.

Bootstrapped via [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Tiff In Tech "todo list" video was the boilerplate.

## Header 2

Start the app with `npm start`.

### H3

Nothing here really

## TODO:

-Fix deckName not being carried between pages

-give ability to users to clear the deck from localStorage

# CSS / UI enhancements:

-desktop res: side-by-side prompt / picture

-mobile res: top/bottom

-Deck Editor page structure:

-Add mobile vs. desktop view

-Challenge "Load Deck" area - make it pretty

-Make challenge screen work for mobile (NO swipe down - this is easily confused with refresh and will break mobile websites)

# Animations + funky features:

-Item added + item removed animation

-ItemList: Reorder deck items by clicking and dragging
